# Models

## Workhorse class
- GPT-4o
    - Fast, also has vision
- Sonnet 3.5 \**New*
    - Abnormally coherent, better at instruction following

## Intelligent, Reasoning Models
*These models spend time "thinking" before answering*

- o1 Preview
    - Excels in scientific analysis and planning
- o1 Mini
    - Optimized for math and coding tasks

## Dirt cheap generalists
- Gemini 1.5 Flash
    - 2M token context window
- GPT-4o-mini
    - Almost free at 60 cents per million output tokens

## Pitfalls
- [Prompt Injection](https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/) described by Simon Willison
    - "Prompt Injection is a security attack against applications built on top of Large Language Models"
- Jailbreaking by Elder Plinius
    - [GPT-4O-LATEST-20241120](https://x.com/elder_plinius/status/1859346651204222983)

## Questions
- What do you consider (if anything) to be your competition?
- What do you think you're missing out on by not having more AI in TalkingParents?
- Do you plan to add something like `Tone Monitoring` to TalkingParents?
- How well eqipped is the team to implement language models in production?
